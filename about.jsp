					<h3>1.PRESIDENT OF INDIA:-</h3></div><br><br>
					<br>
The President of India is the head of the executive, legislature and judiciary of the country. Article 52 of the Constitution of India says that there should <br>be a President of India. Article 53 says that all the executive powers of the Union shall be exercised by him either directly or through officers subordinate<br> to him. 
<br><br>
<div class="col-md-7 wlcome-grid-left"><h3>2. Vice President of India:-</h3></div><br><br>
<br>The office of the Vice President of India is the second highest constitutional office in India after the commander-in-chief of the Indian Armed Forces.<br>
 Also, the Vice President of India is the ex-officio chairperson of the Rajya Sabha. An electoral college consisting of the members of both the Houses of <br>
 Parliament- the Upper House i.e. Rajya Sabha and the Lower House i.e. Lok Sabha, elects the Vice President of India in accordance with the system of proportional 
 representation by means of single transferable vote. The voting in such election is by secret ballot which is conducted by the Election <br>Commission. The Vice President
  of India is not a member of any House of Parliament or of a House of a Legislature of a State. The term of the office <br>of Vice President is five years.
<br><br><div class="col-md-7 wlcome-grid-left"><h3>3.  Prime Minister of India:-</h3></div><br><br>
The Prime Minister of India is the head of the executive branch of the Government of India. His position is distinct from that <br>
of the President of India, who is the head of the State. As India follows a parliamentary system of government modelled after the Westminster system,<br>
 most of the executive powers are exercised by the Prime Minister. He acts as an advisor to the President and is the leader of the Council of Ministers.<br>
  The President appoints the Prime Minister of India and on his advice, appoints the Council of Ministers. The Prime Minister can be a member of either<br>
   the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha.

<br>The Parliament of India is the supreme legislative authority in the country and it is bicameral. It is divided into two houses  the Rajya Sabha, which is the <br>
Council of States, and the Lok Sabha, which is the House of the People. 
<br>The Lok Sabha is referred to as the Lower house and the Rajya Sabha is referred to as the Upper house. The members of the Parliament are either<br>
 elected by the people of India or nominated by the President of India.

 <div class="col-md-7 wlcome-grid-left"><h3>6.Governor of India:-</h3></div><br><br>
<br> 

The Governor is the head of a state just like the President is the head of the republic. The Governor is the nominal head of a state, while the Chief Minister <br>
is the executive head. 
<br>All executive actions of the state are taken in the name of the Governor. However, in reality he merely gives his consent to the various executive actions.<br>
 He or she is devoid of taking any major decisions. The real powers in the executive dealings of a state rest with the Chief Minister and the Council <br>of Ministers.
